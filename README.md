# Airline-Management-System-repo
This project is a console-based Airline Reservation System developed in C++ using file handling for data storage.
It allows admins to manage flights and passengers, while passengers can sign up, log in, book flights, cancel reservations, and view reports.
The system includes input validation, seat management, reservation tracking, and basic system reports for overall monitoring.
